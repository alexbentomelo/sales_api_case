# Architecture Improvements

## 1. Microservices Architecture
**Original Scenario**: The monolithic architecture caused bottlenecks, as all functionalities shared the same resources and codebase.  
**Improvement**: The separation into microservices allows each component to operate and scale independently, improving load distribution and reducing the risk of bottlenecks.

**Benefits**:
- More efficient scalability, adjusting resources according to the demand of each service.
- Reduced impact of isolated failures in a single service, ensuring greater resilience.
- Parallel processing implementation, speeding up complex operations.

## 2. Separation of Operations with CQRS
**Original Scenario**: Read and write operations shared the same pipeline, causing resource competition.  
**Improvement**: The separation between commands (write operations) and queries (read operations) optimizes each type of operation, allocating specific resources to each.

**Benefits**:
- Better performance for read operations, which do not compete with write processes.
- Lower risk of database locks, resulting in a more agile system.
- Independence in scaling read and write services, improving throughput.

## 3. Asynchronous Communication
**Original Scenario**: Synchronous communication increased response time and created dependencies between services.  
**Improvement**: The use of message brokers allows services to communicate asynchronously, processing messages in a decoupled manner.

**Benefits**:
- Reduced wait time between processes, improving overall efficiency.
- Maintenance of critical operations even if parts of the system are temporarily inactive.
- Ability to manage load peaks without overloading services.

## 4. Auto-Scaling and Resource Management
**Original Scenario**: Scalability was limited and required scaling the entire monolithic application, resulting in inefficient resource use.  
**Improvement**: The new architecture allows configuring auto-scaling policies for specific microservices.

**Benefits**:
- Automatic adjustments to handle demand peaks, ensuring stability and performance.
- More efficient use of infrastructure, saving costs.
- Independent services can grow or shrink as needed without impacting others.

## 5. Data Caching
**Original Scenario**: The absence of caching caused overload from repetitive queries, affecting response times.  
**Improvement**: The implementation of in-memory caches, like Redis, enhances the retrieval of frequently accessed data.

**Benefits**:
- Faster queries by serving data directly from the cache.
- Reduced load on the database, freeing resources for other operations.
- High performance maintained during high-demand scenarios.

## 6. Optimized Database Access
**Original Scenario**: A single database handled all operations, limiting concurrency and causing bottlenecks.  
**Improvement**: The architecture distributes access to different databases, with one dedicated to reads and another to writes.

**Benefits**:
- Increased concurrency without affecting read and write performance.
- Ability to optimize each database for its specific purpose, such as indexing for fast queries.
- Reduced resource contention, improving overall response time.

## 7. Improved Network and Connectivity
**Original Scenario**: The fully on-premise environment could have limitations in throughput and latency.  
**Improvement**: The use of dedicated connections like VPN/Direct Connect and communication with mTLS enhances data transfer security and performance.

**Benefits**:
- Reduced latency due to the use of high-bandwidth dedicated connections.
- Predictable and secure data transfer between cloud and on-premise.
- Support for high traffic without network overload.

## 8. Advanced Observability
**Original Scenario**: Limited monitoring tools made it difficult to identify and solve problems.  
**Improvement**: Integration of tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, and OpenTelemetry for metrics collection and centralized logging.

**Benefits**:
- Real-time visibility into system performance, allowing proactive adjustments.
- Faster incident resolution with access to detailed logs and event tracing.
- A data foundation for future performance improvements and resource optimization.

## Conclusion
The modernized architecture offers significant improvements in performance, scalability, and resilience. With enhancements in operation separation, asynchronous communication, caching, and monitoring, the system is better prepared to meet high demands, maintain low response times, and support future growth without compromising user experience.
